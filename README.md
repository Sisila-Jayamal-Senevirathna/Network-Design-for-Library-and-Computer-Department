# Network-Design-for-Library-and-Computer-Department
 University has recently built the library and department buildings. These buildings will house a library, discussion rooms, a department office, lecture halls, lectures room, laboratories, a meeting room, and computer labs. The Objective of the Project is to design a computer network for these buildings of the University using the given requirements and with the optimum use of network IP addresses.

## Design Requirements.
1. Optimum use of network IP addresses. ( Available IP address range is 10.70.0.0/16 )
2. Printers can only be accessed by staff. 
3. Each network node can only be accessed by the administator, not others.
